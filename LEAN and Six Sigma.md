## LEAN Thinking
What is a process? it is a general function, consists of serials actions.
inputs -> Process -> outputs
if they had outputs consumed, they got customers.

### Process mapping
map all the process actions in diagram.
### Value Stream Map 
follows the product
1. values are ***defined by customers***
1. mapping all end-to-end processes, actions
1. make value ***contiunously flow***.
1. let customers ***PULL*** values

### Muda (無駄)、mura (無穩)、muri (無理)

- Muda : No values added
- Muri : Overburden of people or equipment
- Mura : irregular or fluctuating production/workload due to poor planning.
