## LEAN Thinking
What is a process? it is a general function, consists of serials actions.
inputs -> Process -> outputs
if they had outputs consumed, they got customers.

### Process mapping
map all the process actions in diagram.
### Value Stream Map 
follows the product
1. values are ***defined by customers***
1. mapping all end-to-end processes, actions
1. make value ***contiunously flow***.
1. let customers ***PULL*** values

### Muda (無駄)、mura (無穩)、muri (無理)

- Muda : No values added
- Muri : Overburden of people or equipment
- Mura : irregular or fluctuating production/workload due to poor planning.

### TIME
1. Wait time
1. Processing time
also known as touch time TT or response time RT, consists of VAT(Value added time) and NVAT (Non-valued added time).
#### cycle time
a cycle time is wait time + processing time, could be measure for a task, a group of taskes, a process, a group of process. it is a custmizable unit.

### Push system and Pull system
***Push*** is the old-fashioned, when job is done, it is then delivered.

---

***Pull*** system each activity's output is delievred exactly when the next activity's input is needed.

TAKT time = (available time / customers' demand)

### People is the heart

- shared gloal
- shared knowledge
- mutual respect
