And she did, we became friends, and we talk on the phone regualalarlly.
### R: After around something half an year, I was able to make random conversions in English with strangers and I went to Finland in 2019 for my master degree study.

### S: On the thir year of my undergraduate study, I decided to pursue a second level degree abroad. However, except for that idea, I had no answers for questions like which country, what is cost, specialization of study, and so on.
### T: So I need to choose the destionation country, university, filed of study, and recuirements, both academiclly and financially.
### A: I surfed on the internet a lot espcially the forums that popolar with chinese peopel who are studying or working abroad.

### T: I really wished we could know each other better.
### A: So I started to sending someting group, prenteding to ask if anyone knows some interesting activities in the town.

### T: That was a great chance, also very challenging. But inside our team, we got a divergence. Go with artifical intelligence or not. However, none of the memebers had solid experience with AI at that time, so it might be risky as we might not be able to deliver something accountable in the end.
### A: Democracy is as important as air and water for teams. So I proposed to have a meeting internally and a seperate meeting with the company. An evalution of memeber's knowledge about AI and expereince was conducted,and together with a vote weather to go with AI in our project. the answer to no in the end. and during the meeting with company, we asked if AI is their preferable choice for developing their smart wipers, and also how well is AI intergrated inside the company, and the engineering representative told us that they at that moment don't posess too much know-hows about AI, and they are intersted in many other approaches.
### R: In the end we delivered design concepts of smart wipers from perspectives such as self-cleaning, extendability, transparency, etc. The company was very happy, and we got 5 out of 5 from professor for that course.

### A: I searched in the patents database for patents about windshield wipers.didn't get too much inspiration. Looking for ideas on Youtube, same as patent search. One night an idea of measuring the rotate of motors on the wiper system flashed on my mind.
### R: I discussed the possible solution with the mechanically engineer, and he admitted that was never thoughted before, and after reviewing the current technology in their company, he belived it is very likely to be a doable approach with some improvement of design.

I chose Learning analytics because it is close to data science which is quite popular as a subject in the academy and the demand in the job market is very considerable. But I didn't have any data analysis skill or experience before that.
### T: I must learn the theoretical knowledge and practical coding skills in order to complete the project.
### A: I did a deep literature review in a sub-domain under the topic. Borrowed books about R programming language, and took several course on LinkedIn Learning. Checking related public repository on GitHub.
### R: I developed a firm understanding of learning analytiscs and got myself be familar witn R. Now I can use R to wranging big size dataset, and visualize them with different R packages based on the customer needs.

### S: I was learning web development when I was stranded in Finland. As Programmers and nurse are 2 most demanding jobs in Finland. I didn't have money for boot camp, so I chose self learning. Reading books and watching online courses on LinkedIn Learning. 
### T: However, many of the time, the books authors and course instructors use mac os for demonstration, and many of the commands won't work on windows. Buying a new macbook is very expensive.
### A: So I google alternative solutions. It turned out that Linux operating system share more than 95% of the commands with mac os as they are all unix-like system. So I installed Ubuntu on my laptop. and started to learning the command line interface operation. Same as learning coding, starting from introduction books, and then online course.
### R: After about 2 or 3 weeks, I felt comfortable to work on the command line interface on Linux operating system, and I can fowwlowing the course instructor to conitune learning web development. Now I am a fan of Linux, a fan of CLI, open source, and
