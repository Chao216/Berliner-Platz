# 达能 AI

## 1. 主动学习/创造力

### 如何突破舒适区，创造更好的价值
S& T 一直以为接触的电脑操作都是基于微软的Windows平台。有接触过Linux系统，但主要还是使用传统的鼠标控制的图形界面。今年开始学习网页开发。发现自己使用微软的图形界面效率不是十分的高效。所以打算学习Linux 下的命令行界面操作。
Action Linux 命令行大全是我读的第一本书。学习力在终端下大部分鼠标操作的命令行替代，例如路径的变得，文件创建等。随后又在LinkedIn learning 上学了两门 Linux 的课程。在Bilibili 上看了韩顺平老师的LINUX 运维课程，学习了 shell 脚本的知识和常见的案例应用。
R 现在我可以做到不使用鼠标在Linux平台下通过命令行完成大多数任务。
### 主动发现机会，获取资源，最后达到预期
### 超越自我，实现更大的成就

## 2. 抗压能力/问题处理能力
### 遇到困难，如何克服，过程中如何提升自我。
找出问题的根源，确认需求。和相关的负责人沟通看能否有调整的可能。和家人
### 遇到突如其来的变化，如何应对，你做了什么。
## 3. 团队合作/沟通能力
### 团队合作，陷入僵局，怎么说，怎么做。
S 当时我在一个四人小组中，我们的任务是为一家知名的移液管制造商设计新的包装一减少塑料的使用。
T 因为授课教师选择的是网上投票按兴趣成组，成员之间互相并不认识。在项目开始后，小组的项目推进并不顺利
A 于是我向其余的三位成员私下发送了一些消息询问生活，学习方面的事情尝试破冰。
随后我提议一起在学校餐厅一起吃午餐，使各自互相更进一步认识
几天后我发起了线上的群会议，向组员阐释了依据自身知识背景分工的意愿。
R 在那之后，我们每周都会有一次线上的会议，讨论目前各自的进度，并询问是否有成员需要帮助。我们的项目最终如期完成。
### 每个人都有优势，如何取长补短。
又一门课程。有来自各国的同学。有一位印度来的同学非常能言善辩，一位芬兰同学对时间规划之分有经验。我个人比较喜欢做技术类的工作。
所以我们商量好好，决定由芬兰同学安排每周的线上会议，日程指定，我主要负责资料查询，mockup制作等，印度同学主要负责presentation。最后的成果如果靠我们每个人平均分配工作是无法达到的。

### multi-tasking
I would say it is quite common in Finland that you will need to perform multi-tasking jobs at the university. I had a experience that 3 important courses' teaching activities are intensively arranged in the first 8 weeks of the new semester. As a result, i had tonns of reading materials to read, essaies to write, group meetings to participate, and mostly importantly, my personal life to enjoy. 
First I put all the lectures, meeting, deadline of submissions on my calendar, and check if there are any conflicts on time scheduling. fortunately, our university knew such kind of issue, so most courses during covid period that took place on zoom will be recoreded and stored on the uni intranet. hence studnets may watched the recorded video lecture whenever fits them. 
I would prioritize the tasks based on their importance and level of urgency. I also communicate with me flatmates about my study timetable as a quite envrionment without distraction really helps. Sometimes, things just don't go the way you expected, and you only have limited time in your life, so I will set a boundary for tasks, if a considerable amout of time has passed, and the work is not finished, I will contact the stakehoulder to report the situation,and live my own life for healthness and happiness. 

### took extra work in a team
Sometimes team member might quit the team due to all kinds of reasons. I also experienced onece during the sceond year of my postgraduate study. We were a team of 4 in the begining of the course. 1 colleague quitted the team, or precisely the entire course while the project was still in the middle. I contacted the left memeber to understand what has been done, and what will need to be done. And then I discussed with my other 2 colleagues and shared the left work based on our current workload, and individual knowledge and interest. Extra work could arrive at any time, so the best way is to embrace it.  

### put your own needs aside to help others.
I remember it was almost the end of a semester. I had 3 examinations to pass and I was preparing for them, all three are closed books one. 2 days before my firs exam, one of my roommate felt uncomfortable in the morning, and the situation got worse after dinner. I told him that I can take him to hospital, he refused. SO i went on reviwing the course contents for exam preparation, however, I got a feeling that he might be preventing to be ok. So I inisisted to take him to the hospital and he admitted that he felt quite bad. I was there in the hospital with him for the whole night, we went back to the student apartment in the morning the next day after his intravenous injection. 

### adapte to new changing environment
During my second semester, my university decided to move all teaching activities to the online platform due to the increasingly bad covid situation. It wasn't easy for me in the begining, as I prefer to have lectures in a physical classroom. just like having a preference of paperback over kindle books. 
I went to shop, and bought some anime dolls put on my desk, and I treated them like real people, some times I talk with the dolls even though they don't talk back during the course break. But that indeed helped me, as interaction, especially initiatives plays a very imoortant role whhile you are learning something. 

### urgent situation in study.
It happened during the 3rd year of my undergraduate study, the director in in our department invited some korean and mogolian visiting scholars to our uni for a seminar. A lecturer from a course I took needed to make a presentation hwoever, he had some difficulity with English, and he wondered If I could offer some help, such as being the interpretor . I discussed with him togetehr with his ready made slides. It was a big documents with dozens slide pages and paragraphs full of words. I don't have so much time to prepare for so much content as the seminar is in less then 2 days. So I asked if possible to shorten the slides, replace more paragraphs with pictures. and I extract most terms and theme topics from the slides to get myself familar with the presentation. We practiced twice in the classroom with the projecror on, and it worked on the second day. 


### demonstrate your ability of analysis
the field of analysis is very broad and general. But we can simply divide them into qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. I did my master thesis project via the quantitative approach. To measure the performance of individual and the entire class as a complete entity, social network analysis was used to study individual's in-degree and out-degree performance which indicate their prestigae and activeness respectively. Positinal analysis was used for segmentation or simplyly saying griiuping people. ALl those analysis methods are driven by mathmatical calculation which was done by the computer. I used Rstudio, togther with needed R Packages for the above analysis work. 

### a specific problem you solved for classmate or teacher
My thesis supervisor runs a program that provide online courses to the public for free. There are several universities participating in the program. Once he told me that some Chinese students wish to have subtitles for the video lectures. as partially due to language barrier or limited knowledge of the course background. 
So I proposed to make a complete Chinese translation copy for that course. Therefore the students who don't have strong English skills can switch to the CHinese version if needed.

So I spent one month to translate the course contents on the website, and made Chinese scrits for video lectures. The chinese build of the same course was launched in autumn 2021.
